    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because heÂ knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King[1], was the son of Thráin
            II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin
            was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to
            take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
            Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest
            of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.</p>
